# Overview

This was an experiment to build a fully connected deep neural network from scratch, 
including learning via backpropagation using gradient descent. 
I documented the process and the result in this blog post: https://medium.com/@douglasreiser/building-a-deep-neural-network-from-scratch-in-typescript-9028903c15f1
